    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coconut rice is so simple to make and delicious, it’ll quickly become a go-to in your side dish rotation. While coconut rice can be found across the Asian continent and throughout the Pacific, this recipe takes inspiration from a traditional Malaysian recipe called Nasi lemak. Countries like Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia all have similar versions of coconut milk rice, so you can really explore the different ways to make it.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups long grain rice (rinsed)</li>

           <li>1 can (400ml) coconut milk</li> 
            
            <li>1 cup water (or enough to cook the rice)</li>
            
            <li>1 small onion (optional, finely chopped)</li>
            
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil or butter</li>
            
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            
            <li>Optional: bay leaf or a pinch of thyme for extra flavor</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the rice: Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch so it doesn't get sticky.</li>

        <li>Sauté (optional): In a pot, heat oil or butter. Add chopped onion and sauté for a couple of minutes until soft.</li> 
        <li>Add liquid: Pour in the coconut milk and water. Stir in salt (to taste) and any seasonings like bay leaf or thyme.</li>
            
        <li>Add rice: Stir in the rinsed rice. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.</li>
            
        <li>Simmer: Once boiling, reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot tightly (use foil under the lid for a better seal) and let it simmer for 18–25 minutes until the rice is cooked and liquid is absorbed.</li>
            
        <li>Fluff and serve: Remove from heat, let sit for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork. Done!</li>
    </ol>
